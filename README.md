# HW 1 - typography & folder structure

This repo contains the submission for MMED-1056 Homework 1 project by Jin Cheon. 
The project explores web typography and basic JavaScript setup using the provided text and images within a CSS Grid layout. I organized the project structure, included the required JS file, and applied typographic styling such as font selection, line height, letter spacing, and font weight to enhance the page.
